# Commercial License

PIA-PanicGuard is available under a dual-license model:

## Open Source License (GPL-3.0)

For open source projects and general use, PIA-PanicGuard is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

### What GPL-3.0 Allows:
- Free use for personal and commercial purposes
- Modification and distribution of the software
- Creating derivative works

### What GPL-3.0 Requires:
- Source code must remain open and available
- Derivative works must also be licensed under GPL-3.0
- Changes must be documented
- Original copyright and license notices must be preserved

## Commercial License

If you wish to use PIA-PanicGuard in a proprietary product without GPL-3.0 restrictions, a commercial license is available.

### Commercial License Benefits:
- Use PIA-PanicGuard in closed-source/proprietary applications
- No requirement to disclose your source code
- No GPL-3.0 copyleft obligations
- Priority support (optional)
- Custom feature development (optional)

### Commercial License Pricing:

**Contact for pricing:**

Pricing is based on:

- Support requirements

### How It Works:

1. **Contact us** with your use case
2. **Receive a quote** based on your needs
3. **Sign the commercial license agreement**

5. **Use PIA-PanicGuard** in your proprietary application

## Why Dual Licensing?

We believe in open source and want PIA-PanicGuard to be freely available to the community. However, developing and maintaining quality software requires resources. Commercial licensing allows companies that benefit from PIA-PanicGuard in proprietary products to support continued development while keeping the core project open source.

## Questions?

Not sure which license you need? Here's a quick guide:

**Use GPL-3.0 if:**
- Your project is open source
- You're okay with sharing your source code
- You want to use PIA-PanicGuard for free

**Need Commercial License if:**
- Your application is closed-source/proprietary
- You cannot or don't want to share source code
- You're embedding PIA-PanicGuard in a commercial product
